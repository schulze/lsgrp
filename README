Lsgrp lists all the members of a given Unix group.

It is in general not enough to do some greping through /etc/passwd, /etc/group etc., as
systems like NIS, LDAP or Apple's DirectoryServices can add and change user database records.
Lsgrp should also list the members of a group, that don't appear in /etc/passwd or /etc/group.

The Makefile and config.mk were snarfed from the suckless.org project.
The program itself is rather trivial.
